How to publish a new episode
----------------------------


1. Open "verses.csv" in the "data" directory with OpenOffice
------------------------------------------------------------

Set the options:
- charset = UTF-8
- cell separator = tab (tabulation)
- text delimiter = " (double-quote)


2. Review and fix the episode just being translated
---------------------------------------------------

- read aloud, the translation must "flow" naturally although remaining close to the original text
- avoid repetitions
- use "vous" instead of "tu" in most cases (vouvoiement)
- use the present tense in most cases
- correct typos
- verify that the "original-verse-to-confirm" and "translated-verse-to-confirm" contents are in sync with the translation


3. Create the blog message
--------------------------

- decide of a title for the episode
- create an empty blog message with this title

Note that at this point, this message becomes the entry point of the blog, so the (current) publishing should ideally be done quickly.


4. Complete the episode information
-----------------------------------

The episode information must be updated in the first line of the episode:
- add the story title in the "story-title" cell if this is the first episode of a story (leave blank otherwise)
- add the episode title in the "episode-title" cell, this should ideally be the same title that was used to create the blog message 
- add the url of the new blog message in the "url" cell
- add the url to the episode image in the "image-src" cell, see below.
- add the url to the original image in the "image-href" cell, see below.
- add the section original title in the "section-original-title" cell if this is the first episode of a section in the book (leave blank otherwise)
- add the section translated title in the "section-translated-title" cell if this is the first episode of a section in the book (leave blank otherwise)
- save and close the file, do not change the CSV format settings and extension

How to find the url's of the episode image:
- open the album "Diaporama du roman de Renart":
  https://picasaweb.google.com/109570780620280936353/DiaporamaDuRomanDeRenart
- select the image
- click on "link to this photo"
- "select size" = "small 288px"
- check "image only (no link)"
- copy & paste the content of the "embed image" box into the "image-src" cell (see above)
- copy & paste the content of the "link" box into the "image-href" cell (see above)


5. Update the next episode to translate (recommended)
-----------------------------------------------------

- add the number of the next episode in the "episode-number" cell in the first line of this episode
- add the letter "x" in the "is-last-verse" cell in the last line of this episode

Note that this step may be done later.



6. Publish the episode
----------------------

- run the command line: update -u <login> -p <password>


7. Update the table of contents
-------------------------------

- run the command line: update -t
- copy & paste the content of the widget "table-of-contents.html" in the "widgets" directory to the corresponding blog widget
